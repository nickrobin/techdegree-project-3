”Register for Activities” section

Some events are at the same day and time as others. If the user selects a workshop, don't allow selection of a workshop at the same day and time -- you should disable the checkbox and visually indicate that the workshop in the competing time slot isn't available.
When a user unchecks an activity, make sure that competing activities (if there are any) are no longer disabled.
As a user selects activities, a running total should display below the list of checkboxes. For example, if the user selects "Main Conference", then Total: $200 should appear. If they add 1 workshop, the total should change to Total: $300.

The "Credit Card" payment option should be selected by default. Display the #credit-card div, and hide the "PayPal" and "Bitcoin" information. Payment option in the select menu should match the payment option displayed on the page.
When a user selects the "PayPal" payment option, the PayPal information should display, and the credit card and “Bitcoin” information should be hidden.
When a user selects the "Bitcoin" payment option, the Bitcoin information should display, and the credit card and “PayPal” information should be hidden.
NOTE: The user should not be able to select the "Select Payment Method" option from the payment select menu, because the user should not be able to submit the form without a chosen payment option.
